<p>Bodies are cool, but finicky, and sometimes they don’t do what we want. A friend of mine has some unexplained nerve pain in their hands, and it hurts for them to type on a keyboard or swipe on a touchscreen. At their request, I made them a device which connects wirelessly to an iPad and reads their waved hand gestures to touchlessly navigate pages in an e-book, allowing for pain-free reading. I built this page turner from some electronic parts from Adafruit and a 3D printed enclosure.</p>

<p>A search for “gesture sensor” introduced me to Adafruit’s <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595">APDS-9960 breakout board</a>. I wanted the page turner to be small and portable, so it can travel conveniently with the e-reader, so I selected the smallest microcontroller package and battery I wanted to work with: the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5700">QT Py S3</a> (an ESP32-S3 breakout) with a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5397">charger BFF</a> and a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3898">400mAh lipo</a>. These all interconnect with JST cables, so all that needed soldering were some pin headers and an extra wire for the APDS-9960’s interrupt pin. The interrupt connection could be skipped, but it helps improve battery life by not requiring the QT Py to constantly poll the sensor.</p>

<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>

<p>I cut a wire ~1.5” long and soldered it between the QT Py’s A3 and the sensor’s INT.</p>

<figure class="image">

    <figcaption>Note that the wire enters through the back of each board.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>I soldered pin headers onto the QT Py, skipping over A3,</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/pin_headers.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/pin_headers_mid.jpg" alt="pin headers" /></a></p>

<p>then finally soldered the charger BFF to those headers.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/charger_attached.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/charger_attached_mid.jpg" alt="charger attached" /></a></p>

<p>The components were connected together via JST cables and the wires were carefully bent into shape to scrunch everything into the right orientations.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/jst_attached.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/jst_attached_mid.jpg" alt="JST cables" /></a></p>

<p>I outsourced enclosure design to a friend who came up with this phenomenal first model:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/first_model.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/first_model_mid.jpg" alt="first model" /></a></p>

<p>A cap fits over the charger BFF’s onboard power switch to make it usable through the enclosure.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/switch_cap.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/switch_cap_mid.jpg" alt="switch cap" /></a></p>

<p>A light pipe, printed from translucent PCTG, brings the light of the status LED from the QT Py around to the same side as the switch.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/light_pipe.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/light_pipe_mid.jpg" alt="light pipe" /></a></p>

<p>The battery charge indicator simply shines up through a hole.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/charging.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/charging_mid.jpg" alt="charging" /></a></p>

<p>Some heat-set inserts were pressed in with a soldering iron to let the enclosure screw together. A spare pair on the back could be used to mount a clip, so the device could be clipped onto the side of the e-reader itself.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/page_turner/inserts.jpg"><img src="/assets/page_turner/inserts_mid.jpg" alt="heat set inserts" /></a></p>

<p>The completed page turner:</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The software for this project ended up relatively simple. You can check it out at <a href="http://github.com/brushyfork23/page_turner">github.com/brushyfork23/page_turner</a>.</p>

<p>Originally I had configured a right-to-left swipe to advance the page and a left-to-right swipe to go back, but some real world testing revealed that you mostly only want to go forward and it’s tiring to swing your hand back around the sensor. I changed from gesture sensing to simple proximity sensing, and now the device can be used in any orientation by passing a finger back and forth.</p>

<p>Basic battery monitoring is done by a scan at startup and the device flashes green, orange, or red to indicate the charge percentage remaining.</p>

<h2 id="struggles">Struggles</h2>

<p>The part of the enclosure where the sensor meets the face took a lot of iteration, because if there was any gap between the sensor and the enclosure aperture then the IR LED would flood the inside of the case and cause false positives.</p>

    <figcaption>The final working design.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>When I started this project, I didn’t have my own 3D printer, so each iteration required finding time on another available friend’s machine. It was impossible to adjust for the sensor gap because the tolerances of each person’s printer were different, so I finally decided I was ready and purchased my own. I bought a <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusa-core-one-kit/">Prusa Core One</a> and some <a href="https://www.3dfuel.com/collections/1-75mm-pro-pctg/products/pro-pctg-ocean-blue-1-75mm">Pro PCTG filament from 3D-Fuel</a>, and was printing with fantastic results right away once I configured <a href="https://support.3dfuel.com/hc/en-us/articles/22046343945495-Pro-PCTG-Print-Profiles">3D-Fuel’s print profiles</a>.</p>

<p>Having a printer allowed me to experiment with true rapid prototyping. I printed the specific section of the model I was having trouble with and iterated on it alone, using only a gram or so of filament each time and only taking 5 minutes between versions. A month of failed back-and-forth was solved in just a few hours!</p>

An obviously horrible location, as it was treacherous to store other things in the closet around and on top of the bottles, and we could never remember what we had.</p>

<p>Recently inspiration struck when looking at a bare patch of wall, and now we have a new booze shelf!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/booze_shelf/booze_shelf.jpg"><img src="/assets/booze_shelf/booze_shelf_mid.jpg" alt="booze shelf" /></a></p>

<p>We’d talked about doing a two-tiered set of shelves in the corner of the dining room, but the stud locations and tight quarters meant we’d need custom brackets. It was too much start up energy and the project idea languished.</p>

<p>While we’ve found brass brackets we like for most other shelves in the house, they’re expensive, and this one is tucked out of the way so keeping things cheap seemed ideal. Shelf and bracket are simply the IKEA <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bergshult-ramshult-wall-shelf-white-s99325477/">BERGSHULT / RAMSHULT combo</a>.</p>

<p>But what was necessary to take from the inspo was the railing. Railing allows the full surface of the shelf to be used without fear of bottles falling onto your head. Instead of tracking down fancy museum railing, I thought it would be simple to just make my own. I ordered some <a href="https://www.onlinemetals.com/en/buy/brass/0-1875-brass-round-bar-360-h02-extruded/pid/4345">3/16” brass round bar</a> from onlinemetals.com, then cut it down into small segments on the bandsaw and rounded the cut ends on the belt sander. I bent them into U shapes with a metal bender, and sanded them shiny with steel wool. Tight fitting holes were drilled half of the depth into the shelf and the railings were able to press fit in place.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cut and bent some brass into little railings for a shelf to hold our booze.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://michaelblackmade.com/assets/booze_shelf/booze_shelf.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://michaelblackmade.com/assets/booze_shelf/booze_shelf.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Now Playing</title><link href="https://michaelblackmade.com/2024/01/11/now-playing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Now Playing" /><published>2024-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>https://michaelblackmade.com/2024/01/11/now-playing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://michaelblackmade.com/2024/01/11/now-playing.html"><![CDATA[<p>We needed somewhere to place the sleeve for the currently-playing record. We had an IKEA picture ledge from our old apartment that just needed to be hung up. But before we got around to it, my wife came to me and mused: “Most of the time I’m listening to the radio, and I’d love to see the name of the song or artist without having to pull out my phone. Can you put a ticker of the live feed on the front of the shelf?”</p>

<p>It took less than 30 minutes to report an excited “yes!”</p>

<p>Our fabulous local radio station, <a href="https://kexp.org/">KEXP</a>, has a real time playlist you can query through their API. I grabbed a microcontroller, a screen, and some other bits I had on hand, and threw together a working prototype. Knowing I had some scrap wood, I decided it would be a fun constraint to build this without buying anything new.</p>

<p>Two boards were joined into a T, making a shelf with a lip to hold up the record and a face to mount the screen into. I cut a slot in the face board that the shelf board could press-fit into using a table saw.</p>

<p>A few features added in were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A switch on the front to turn the screen on and off</li>
  <li>A hidden reed switch on the shelf to detect when it was holding a record.</li>
  <li>Two LEDs on the front which turn on when a record is detected</li>
  <li>A hidden contrast knob for the LCD</li>
  <li>The words “NOW PLAYING” etched into the wood</li>
</ul>

<p>I used a router to cut a recess so the LCD would sit flush against the front, then got everything except the front LEDs mounted, wired, and working.</p>

</figure>

<p>A friend offered to use his laser to etch the front, so we gave it a shot. This was a new technique for us, and we learned a lot about the machine and how to interact with cheap wood. In hindsight I don’t think the fill pattern works as well with the wood grain as perhaps just an outline would have.</p>

<p>I then stained the wood, glued and reassembled everything, and installed the LEDs on either side of the etched words.</p>

<p>I did unfortunately have to go buy brackets to mount this to the wall, which sadly brought the project cost up to $4. So close!</p>

<p>It’s simultaneously exactly what we need while also being pretty rough and clunky. I don’t love the screen, the etching looks dull, and the front LEDs are totally unnecessary. But it was fun to build, and it was a great way to use up some parts that would otherwise just collect dust.</p>

<p>The code is here if you’re interested: <a href="https://github.com/brushyfork23/now-playing/blob/main/now_playing.ino">github.com/brushyfork23/now-playing</a>. I wrote it quickly and never looked back, so it’s missing some key features. Overflowing text doesn’t scroll into view, and there’s some encoding mismatch so characters are often garbled. But it works well enough to answer the question “who’s playing?”</p>

<p>PS: the old picture ledge we had from our last apartment? I repurposed it and its brethren to hold shallow items in the garage.</p>

<p>The station I’m moving away from is the “<a href="https://sciplus.com/led-magnifying-work-stand-with-third-hand">LED Magnifying Work Stand With Third Hand</a>” sold by American Science &amp; Surplus:</p>

<figure class="image">
    <a href="/assets/solder_dispenser/station.jpg"><img src="/assets/solder_dispenser/station_small.jpg" alt="combination workstation" /></a>
    
    <figcaption>The solder dispenser is that black horizontal bar in the back.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>It’s got a lot of features, each providing a use I’ve come to rely on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>helper hands clamp</li>
  <li>gooseneck alligator clip third hand</li>
  <li>soldering iron stand</li>
  <li>brass wool holder</li>
  <li>light / magnifying glass</li>
  <li>solder dispenser</li>
</ul>

<p>But after working with it for so long, I’ve identified the tools and processes that will better serve my needs.</p>

<p>The move started when I received an <a href="https://omnifixo.com/en-us/products/of-m4-pre-order">Omnifixo M4</a> as a gift. I love this clamp set, particularly because it lets me get very precise holds easily in a way I never could with the springy gooseneck arm. It also lets me hold multiple things independently, something that was frustratingly difficult when all your clamps are fixed to the same base.</p>

<p>I clean my soldering iron tip by dragging it toward me across brass wool, which consequently sends little bits of metal flying everywhere. This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TGNWCS">soldering iron and brass wool holder</a> has a great domed covering that keeps the splatter contained. I also really appreciate being able to stash the iron away from my clamped workpiece.</p>

<p>I have a positionable light panel on the workbench, and I love this <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800088970007.html">cheap handheld magnifier</a> ($3.97 shipped when I got it), so the only missing component to be replaced was the solder dispenser.</p>

<p>I thought for a moment about buying something purpose-built, but instead I looked around the room for an axle and frame and landed on this:</p>

<figure class="image">
    <a href="/assets/solder_dispenser/perspective.jpg"><img src="/assets/solder_dispenser/perspective_mid.jpg" alt="two popsicle sticks shoved through slits in folded cardboard, holding solder spools" /></a>
    
    <figcaption>Two popsicle sticks and a scrap of cardboard.  That's it.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>I often start with a cardboard prototype for project enclosures, but this combination of paper and popsicle sticks does what I need and seems strong enough to last.</p>

<p>I drilled holes in the ends of the sticks so I could use a safety pin to stop them from slipping out, but that turned out completely unnecessary. The press fit of the popsicle stick through a slit in the cardboard is plenty sturdy to keep things in place.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <a href="/assets/solder_dispenser/side.jpg"><img src="/assets/solder_dispenser/side_mid.jpg" alt="side view" /></a>
    
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The holes in the front stick are very useful, though, as they keep the threaded solder from getting lost on the spool.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <a href="/assets/solder_dispenser/solder_dispenser.jpg"><img src="/assets/solder_dispenser/solder_dispenser_mid.jpg" alt="solder dispenser" /></a>
    
    <figcaption></figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>While this does stay in place when the solder is pulled from it, I added some adhesive rubber feet to the bottom to give it a little extra grip. Now it can take a hefty tug and still stay put.</p>

<figure class="image">

</figure>

<p>If I had a 3D printer, I’m sure I would have made something out of plastic. It would have been irresistible. But I’m actually really thankful I don’t and didn’t. This folded piece of cardboard is tough and rigid enough that I expect this dispenser to last for many years. And when its end does come, I can just toss it in the compost and make another.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes the cardboard prototype is all you need.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://michaelblackmade.com/assets/solder_dispenser/solder_dispenser.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://michaelblackmade.com/assets/solder_dispenser/solder_dispenser.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
