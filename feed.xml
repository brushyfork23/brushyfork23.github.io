<p>Recently inspiration struck when looking at a bare patch of wall, and now we have a new booze shelf!</p>

<p>We’d talked about doing a two-tiered set of shelves in the corner of the dining room, but the stud locations and tight quarters meant we’d need custom brackets. It was too much start up energy and the project idea languished.</p>

<p>The design north star had been this photo my wife sent me from <a href="https://aglassofbovino.com/2020/06/main-bathroom-one-room-challenge-the-reveal-spring-2020/">A Glass of Bovino</a>:</p>

<p>While we’ve found brass brackets we like for most other shelves in the house, they’re expensive, and this one is tucked out of the way so keeping things cheap seemed ideal. Shelf and bracket are simply the IKEA <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/bergshult-ramshult-wall-shelf-white-s99325477/">BERGSHULT / RAMSHULT combo</a>.</p>

<p>But what was necessary to take from the inspo was the railing. Railing allows the full surface of the shelf to be used without fear of bottles falling onto your head. Instead of tracking down fancy museum railing, I thought it would be simple to just make my own. I ordered some <a href="https://www.onlinemetals.com/en/buy/brass/0-1875-brass-round-bar-360-h02-extruded/pid/4345">3/16” brass round bar</a> from onlinemetals.com, then cut it down into small segments on the bandsaw and rounded the cut ends on the belt sander. I bent them into U shapes with a metal bender, and sanded them shiny with steel wool. Tight fitting holes were drilled half of the depth into the shelf and the railings were able to press fit in place.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="home improvement" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Kid became mobile, we had to ditch our bar cart and temporarily stash our booze on the floor of a closet.
